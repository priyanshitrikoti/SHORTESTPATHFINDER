# SHORTESTPATHFINDER
Interactive web-based Shortest Path Finder using Dijkstra’s Algorithm. Built with Python Flask for backend and HTML/CSS/JS for frontend visualization. Users can set start/end points, draw obstacles, and see the algorithm explore and find the shortest path step by step.
# Shortest Path Finder – Dijkstra's Algorithm

## Overview
Interactive web-based Shortest Path Finder built using **Dijkstra’s Algorithm**.  
This project demonstrates how the algorithm explores a grid to find the shortest path between two points, even with obstacles.  
It uses **Python Flask** for backend logic and **HTML/CSS/JavaScript** for frontend visualization.

## Features
- Place **Start** and **End** points on a grid
- Draw **Walls / Obstacles** to block paths
- Visualize Dijkstra’s **step-by-step exploration**
- Interactive and responsive UI
- Educational tool for understanding **Greedy Algorithms** and **Graph Traversal"
